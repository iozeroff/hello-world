# hello-world
This is my fight song!
I'm new to coding and programming. I've always been a liberal arts focused kind of dude, studied political science in college, love to write creatively and read fiction. But I'm incredibly passionate about the environment and have made it a focus of my career, and the thing about the environment is how critical science and data are to preserving it. So I've decided to pursue data science as a way to engage others and learn about environmental issues. 
I've been learning statistics and R for about 6 months now and am fully engrossed, and looking to continue pursuing it both by expanding my role at work (I work at an environmental non-profit, and in my personal pursuits.
